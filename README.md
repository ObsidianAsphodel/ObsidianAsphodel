After many years working Retail and in warehouses, a career change was in order. For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a programmer. The First Robotics Competition was my first foray into programming, and my interest only grew in size. As the years went by, I would dive into game development, developing in Unity using C#. But my first big push into the industry was learning front end development. 

Skills: HTML / CSS / Javascript / Boostrap / JQuery / React / C# / Unity

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Front End Development through the Promineo Tech Bootcamp 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm also an illustrator/ 3d modeler!

After many years working retail and in warehouses, a career change was in order. For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a programmer. The First Robotics Competition was my first foray into programming, and my interest only grew in size. I would dive into game development, developing in Unity using C#. But my first big push into the industry was learning front end development.

I'm excited to finally enter into the industry and start on my path to becoming a better programmer!
